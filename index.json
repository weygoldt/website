PlatformIO is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, and multiple framework tool that can help with this. It is designed to make hardware development more comfortable and more efficient.\nPlatformIO is typically advertised as a VSCode plugin, which turns VSCode into an Arduino IDE-like platform. However, there is a lesser-known feature that developers can take advantage of - the simple command-line toolbox. In this blog post, we will walk you through how to install and use PlatformIO via the command line.\nTo begin, PlatformIO is a Python package, so it can be installed from PyPI, including within a virtual environment. However, it is highly recommended to use PlatformIO\u0026rsquo;s installation script instead. Here\u0026rsquo;s how you can install PlatformIO using the installation script:\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformio/platformio-core-installer/master/get-platformio.py -o get-platformio.py python3 get-platformio.py During installation, PlatformIO creates its virtual environment, which is beneficial since it doesn\u0026rsquo;t interfere with system packages. However, the standard shell doesn\u0026rsquo;t recognize the PlatformIO executables, so we need to create symbolic links. You can do that using the following commands:\nln -s ~/.platformio/penv/bin/platformio ~/.local/bin/platformio ln -s ~/.platformio/penv/bin/pio ~/.local/bin/pio ln -s ~/.platformio/penv/bin/piodebuggdb ~/.local/bin/piodebuggdb On a Linux system, you also need to add udev rules. This snippet downloads the rules, places them in the appropriate location, reloads the udev service, and adds the current user to the relevant groups:\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformio/platformio-core/develop/platformio/assets/system/99-platformio-udev.rules | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-platformio-udev.rules To restart udev on debian-based distributions, run:\nsudo service udev restart sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER sudo usermod -a -G plugdev $USER On arch-based distributions, use the following instead:\nsudo udevadm control --reload-rules sudo udevadm trigger sudo usermod -a -G uucp $USER sudo usermod -a -G lock $USER Log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.\nBy default, PlatformIO enables telemetry. However, you can disable it by running:\npio settings set enable_telemetry No pio settings get Next, you can initialize pio in your directory by creating an example project directory, for example, mkdir pio_test \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd pio_test. Then, list all the available boards (platforms) by running pio boards. Choose your board and run:\npio project init --ide vim --board teensy41 Now you can edit the source code using your editor of choice. To test if the code compiles, you can simply run:\npio run To flash an attached board, add the following:\npio run --target upload For convenience, I personally created shell aliases comp for compilation and flash to upload. If you let your device access the serial port to print some debug information, you can monitor this by running:\npio device In conclusion, PlatformIO is a powerful tool for hardware development that provides a flexible and efficient workflow for software developers working with hardware. With its support for multiple platforms, frameworks, and libraries, along with a command-line interface and integrated debugging, PlatformIO is an excellent choice for anyone looking to streamline their hardware development workflow.\nPhoto by Vishnu Mohanan on Unsplash\n","date":"1 May 2023","permalink":"/posts/platformio-introduction/","section":"Posts","summary":"An introduction to PlatformIO, an open-source tool that makes software development for microcontroller prototyping platforms more convenient.","title":"PlatformIO - Lazy hardware development from the command line."},{"content":"","date":"1 May 2023","permalink":"/categories/post/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Post"},{"content":"","date":"1 May 2023","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"Hi there, I\u0026rsquo;m Patrick!

I\u0026rsquo;m really glad you\u0026rsquo;re here, and I\u0026rsquo;m excited to share a bit about myself with you. Allow me to introduce myself:\nI\u0026rsquo;m Patrick, a German master\u0026rsquo;s student with a strong passion for animal behavior and data analysis. This platform is like a digital canvas where I get to show you who I am, both in my personal and professional life.\nOn the personal side, I just love making things – whether it\u0026rsquo;s software, hardware, photos, or whatever sparks my interest. It all began back in my high school art classes with drawing, painting, and sculpting. Over time, this creative spark evolved into the digital realm through photography and videography. During my studies I then discovered my enthusiasm for software development and data science and, working on my thesis, even hardware projects. These days, most of my creative energy finds expression through coding. Additionally, I am strongly drawn to the outdoors. I enjoy going on multi-day hiking trips, and I\u0026rsquo;m really motivated to further my education as a diver, a skill that I\u0026rsquo;m sure will come in handy for my future research.\nShifting to my academic journey, I\u0026rsquo;ve invested a good chunk of time in studying biology, especially animal behavior. Right now, I\u0026rsquo;m pursuing two master\u0026rsquo;s degrees – one in Evolution and Ecology and another in Neurobiology at the University of Tuebingen. The plan is to combine my foundation in evolutionary biology with advanced data analysis skills from the field of neurobiology. What really excites me is where these two fields intersect – animal behavior. My ultimate aim is to contribute meaningfully to the dynamic world of behavioral biology by understanding how weakly electric fish communicate and interact socially.\nBut beyond my academic pursuits, I\u0026rsquo;m generally fueled by a strong desire to create and learn. I firmly believe that the pursuit of knowledge plays a huge role in shaping the world, and I\u0026rsquo;m dedicated to using my personal knowledge and skills to make a positive impact.\nThanks a lot for visiting! Feel free to get in touch through your preferred way of communication. Let\u0026rsquo;s set out on this adventure together and build connections that go way beyond the digital realm.\nWarm regards,\nPatrick\n","date":"25 February 2023","permalink":"/about/","section":"About me","summary":"Photo courtesy of Lena Wesenberg Welcome to my personal and academic website!

I hope you find them interesting!\nDetecting communication signals of weakly electric fish # To understand the meaning of certain communication signals, we need to be able to detect them. With chirps, a transient frequency modulation of the electric organ discharge, this is particularly challenging. In most of the research to date, fish where immobilized and stimulated artifically or kept physically seperated, conditions not particularly advantageous for natural communication.\nTo solve this, I developed a detector based on a convolutional neural network that can detect chirps in freely behaving fish. The detector was initially trained on large datasets of simulated chirps, which suprisingly, after some fine-tuning, transferred well to real data. With this version I was able to detect approximately 50 000 chirps, the largest dataset of chirps at that time.\nThe following image shows a short snippet of a recording of two fish. Chirps are visible on a spectrogram as excursions in frequency from the baseline of one of the two fish. The dots indicate where the detector detected a chirp.\nA spectrogram of a recording of two fish. The dots indicate where the detector detected a chirp. I am currently working on using the resulting dataset, manually annotating and correcting it to train a new detector that should perform even better on more complex recordings.\nweygoldt/cnn-chirpdetector A first try of detecting the transient communication signals of weakly electric fish on a spectrogram using a convolutional neural network. Python 0 1 Singing in the dark: Synchronous frequency modulations of weakly electric fish # While looking through a two-week continuous recording of electric fish in their natural habitat, I noticed that some frequency modulations on the scale of seconds up two ten minutes happened in synchrony between two fish. I developed a detector that can detect these modulations and used it to analyze the recordings.\nUsing estimated positions of the fish over time, I was able to show that fish that participate in these interactions approach each other after they initated their \u0026ldquo;choir\u0026rdquo;. This work resulted in a poster presented at the 2022 international conference of Neuroethology (ICN), that you can find in the github repository below.\nweygoldt/synchronous-modulations Working directory including scripts for the analysis of synchronised EOD frequency modulations in freely interacting Black Ghost Knifefish recorded in Colombia. Jupyter Notebook 0 0 Additionally, I rendered some of these diadic interactions as videos, where you can see the fish moving as data points on the electrode grid and their frequencies evolving on the right.\nColorblind direction cells in the zebrafish optic tectum # Behvioral experiments already showed that zebrafish are likely to not perceive motion if the sole feature that is moving is color. Instead, brightness differences between moving stimuli where needed to elicit a response (Orger and Baier, 2005). For a project during a lab rotation, we investigated how this behavior is reflected in the optic tectum, the main visual processing center in fish.\nTo do this, we used two-photon calcium imaging to record the activity of direction selective neurons in the optic tectum of zebrafish larvae. In addition, we simultaneously recorded the optokinetic response, a behavioral proxy of motion perception.\nOur analysis indicated that the direction selective neurons in the optic tectum are most likely colorblind, meaning that they respond to brightness differences but not to color differences. This experiment also resulted in a poster as well as a more detailed report, both of which you can find in the github repository below.\nweygoldt/colorblind-directioncells A lab rotation with the systems neuroscience lab, University of Tuebingen, where we tested whether color contrast contributed to encoding motion in direction selective cells of the zebrafish optic tectum.

I got into Linux when I started working in the Neuroethology lab at the University of Tuebingen, where everybody was using it. I was immediately hooked by the idea of a free and open operating system that is not only highly customizable but also very secure. I have been using Linux as my main operating system for approximately 2 years. I am currently running Arch Linux with the Hyprland window manager on both my personal laptop and work PC. I keep a dotfiles repository on GitHub where I store my configuration files and scripts.\nweygoldt/dotfiles The configuration files for my arch linux workstation.

I started diving after my starting to work in a marine biology lab and have been diving in Germany, Indonesia and the Mediterranean Sea. I am really excited to further my education as a diver, a skill that I\u0026rsquo;m sure will come in handy for my future research. I am particulary drawn towards the idea of becoming a technical- and cave diver to be able to explore challenging environments. In 2023 I got a first chance to combine this skill with my work during a four-week stay at the STARESO marine research station where I assisted PhD-students during sample collection dives.\nScorpion fish catching in the Mediterranean sea.

Nowadays, I don\u0026rsquo;t have as much time for photography as I used to, but I still enjoy hiking, even if I rarely take my camera.
