PlatformIO is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, and multiple framework tool that can help with this. It is designed to make hardware development more comfortable and more efficient.\nPlatformIO is typically advertised as a VSCode plugin, which turns VSCode into an Arduino IDE-like platform. However, there is a lesser-known feature that developers can take advantage of - the simple command-line toolbox. In this blog post, we will walk you through how to install and use PlatformIO via the command line.\nTo begin, PlatformIO is a Python package, so it can be installed from PyPI, including within a virtual environment. However, it is highly recommended to use PlatformIO\u0026rsquo;s installation script instead. Here\u0026rsquo;s how you can install PlatformIO using the installation script:\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformio/platformio-core-installer/master/get-platformio.py -o get-platformio.py python3 get-platformio.py During installation, PlatformIO creates its virtual environment, which is beneficial since it doesn\u0026rsquo;t interfere with system packages. However, the standard shell doesn\u0026rsquo;t recognize the PlatformIO executables, so we need to create symbolic links. You can do that using the following commands:\nln -s ~/.platformio/penv/bin/platformio ~/.local/bin/platformio ln -s ~/.platformio/penv/bin/pio ~/.local/bin/pio ln -s ~/.platformio/penv/bin/piodebuggdb ~/.local/bin/piodebuggdb On a Linux system, you also need to add udev rules. This snippet downloads the rules, places them in the appropriate location, reloads the udev service, and adds the current user to the relevant groups:\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformio/platformio-core/develop/platformio/assets/system/99-platformio-udev.rules | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-platformio-udev.rules To restart udev on debian-based distributions, run:\nsudo service udev restart sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER sudo usermod -a -G plugdev $USER On arch-based distributions, use the following instead:\nsudo udevadm control --reload-rules sudo udevadm trigger sudo usermod -a -G uucp $USER sudo usermod -a -G lock $USER Log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.\nBy default, PlatformIO enables telemetry. However, you can disable it by running:\npio settings set enable_telemetry No pio settings get Next, you can initialize pio in your directory by creating an example project directory, for example, mkdir pio_test \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd pio_test. Then, list all the available boards (platforms) by running pio boards. Choose your board and run:\npio project init --ide vim --board teensy41 Now you can edit the source code using your editor of choice. To test if the code compiles, you can simply run:\npio run To flash an attached board, add the following:\npio run --target upload For convenience, I personally created shell aliases comp for compilation and flash to upload. If you let your device access the serial port to print some debug information, you can monitor this by running:\npio device In conclusion, PlatformIO is a powerful tool for hardware development that provides a flexible and efficient workflow for software developers working with hardware. With its support for multiple platforms, frameworks, and libraries, along with a command-line interface and integrated debugging, PlatformIO is an excellent choice for anyone looking to streamline their hardware development workflow.\nPhoto by Vishnu Mohanan on Unsplash\n","date":"1 May 2023","permalink":"/posts/platformio-introduction/","section":"Posts","summary":"An introduction to PlatformIO, an open-source tool that makes software development for microcontroller prototyping platforms more convenient.","title":"PlatformIO - Lazy hardware development from the command line."},{"content":"","date":"1 May 2023","permalink":"/categories/post/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Post"},{"content":"","date":"1 May 2023","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"Hi there, I\u0026rsquo;m Patrick!

I\u0026rsquo;m really glad you\u0026rsquo;re here, and I\u0026rsquo;m excited to share a bit about myself with you. Allow me to introduce myself:\nI\u0026rsquo;m Patrick, a German master\u0026rsquo;s student with a strong passion for animal behavior and data analysis. This platform is like a digital canvas where I get to show you who I am, both in my personal and professional life.\nOn the personal side, I just love making things – whether it\u0026rsquo;s software, hardware, photos, or whatever sparks my interest. It all began back in my high school art classes with drawing, painting, and sculpting. Over time, this creative spark evolved into the digital realm through photography and videography. During my studies I then discovered my enthusiasm for software development and data science and, working on my thesis, even hardware projects. These days, most of my creative energy finds expression through coding. Additionally, I am strongly drawn to the outdoors. I enjoy going on multi-day hiking trips, and I\u0026rsquo;m really motivated to further my education as a diver.\nShifting to my academic journey, I\u0026rsquo;ve invested a good chunk of time in studying biology, especially animal behavior. Right now, I\u0026rsquo;m pursuing two master\u0026rsquo;s degrees – one in Evolution and Ecology and another in Neurobiology at the University of Tuebingen. The plan is to combine my foundation in evolutionary biology with advanced data analysis skills from the field of neurobiology. What really excites me is where these two fields intersect – animal behavior. My ultimate aim is to contribute meaningfully to the dynamic world of behavioral biology by understanding how weakly electric fish communicate and interact socially.\nBut beyond my academic pursuits, I\u0026rsquo;m generally fueled by a strong desire to create and learn. I firmly believe that the pursuit of knowledge plays a huge role in shaping the world, and I\u0026rsquo;m dedicated to using my personal knowledge and skills to make a positive impact.\nThanks a lot for visiting! Feel free to get in touch through your preferred way of communication. Let\u0026rsquo;s set out on this adventure together and build connections that go way beyond the digital realm.\nWarm regards,\nPatrick\n","date":"25 February 2023","permalink":"/about/","section":"About me","summary":"Previous Nextsads Welcome to my personal and academic website!
