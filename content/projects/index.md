In my research I apply advanced data analysis techniques 
to unstructured data from passive electric recorders in the field
to learn about the social behavior of electric fish.

## Communication and social behavior of electric fish in the wild

Why are some species social while others are not? How do animals communicate
with each other, and what information do they convey? These questions drive my
research, which lies at the intersection of ecology, behavior, and
neurobiology. I am broadly interested in how these fields can be integrated to
understand the development and function of **social behaviors** and **communication**
in animals.

Electric fish offer a unique opportunity to study these phenomena as they offer
a wide variety of social lives that can be explored through electric signals.
We design and deploy electrode arrays and required analysis software to monitor
electric fish in their natural habitats. This non-invasive technology captures
electrolocation- and communication signals and tracks movement, providing
detailed, quantitative observation of behavior in the wildâ€”an approach that is
unique to electric fish.

Using data analyses and machine learning, we process the large-scale
datasets generated from field recordings, which allows us to detect subtle
patterns in communication and movement. I aim to observe, compare, and
understand social interactions in electric eels and other species of electric
fish in their natural environments.

By combining the study of communication signals and movement patterns, I seek
to uncover how and why animals interact during courtship, competition, and
foraging. This way, we might start to understand how communication mediates
complex social behaviors in species where little is currently known, let alone
observable in the wild.

Electric fish have already been a focus during my master's studies, which
resulted in the following two projects:
