Hi, I'm Patrick! I am a behavioral biologist with a passion for data analysis
and fieldwork. After finishing two Masters degrees, one in Neurobiology and one
in Evolution and Ecology, I am now pursuing a PhD at the
[Neuroethology](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/biologie/institute/neurobiologie/lehrbereiche/neuroethology/)
Lab at the University of Tuebingen. My research focuses on the social behavior
of electric fish, where I apply advanced data analysis techniques to
unstructured data from passive electric recorders in the field to learn about
the social behavior of electric fish.

## What drives my research

Why are some species social while others are not? How do animals communicate
with each other, and what information do they convey? These questions drive my
research, which lies at the intersection of ecology, behavior, and
neurobiology. I am broadly interested in how these fields can be integrated to
understand the development and function of **social behaviors** and **communication**
in animals.

Electric fish offer a unique opportunity to study these phenomena as they offer
a wide variety of social lives that can be explored through electric signals.
We design and deploy electrode arrays and required analysis software to monitor
electric fish in their natural habitats. This non-invasive technology captures
electrolocation- and communication signals and tracks movement, providing
detailed, quantitative observation of behavior in the wildâ€”an approach that is
unique to electric fish.

## Data analysis

I mainly work with Python and use libraries like `PyTorch`, `SciPy`, and
`scikit-learn` for data analysis. I like data wrangling, building data
pipelines, and managing multi-terrabyte datasets, and have experience in
supervised and unsupervised learning, dimensionality reduction, and fine-tuning
deep learning models such as MLPs, CNNs, YOLO, and RCNN. I really enjoy
creating visualizations, some of which you can find on here:

On a personal note, I am a big proponent of open software and hardware, open
data, and open science. I believe that sharing knowledge, tools and data is
essential for reproducibility and the advancement of science. This is why I am
a big fan of anything scriptable: Code is the best way to document, share and
reproduce data analysis workflows. You can find anything including analysis
code, poster and presentation templates and my Linux system configuration on my
[GitHub](https://github.com/weygoldt) page.

## Fieldwork

Aside from data analysis, I really enjoy the outdoors. I am a certified
Advanced Open Water Diver and have been diving in Germany, Indonesia and the
Mediterranean Sea. I have fieldwork experience in the Amazon rainforest
studying electric fish, and have worked at the STARESO marine research station
in Corsica, where I assisted PhD-students during sample collection dives. I'm
somebody who enjoys the challenge of working in remote locations and difficult
conditions, and I am always looking for new opportunities to expand my
fieldwork experience. Aside from the rainforest and underwater, I would
especially love to do some work in caves at some point in the future.
