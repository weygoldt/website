With knowledge in applied machine learning, software development, and data
analysis, I am currently pursuing masterâ€™s degrees in Neurobiology and
Evolution and Ecology. My focus is on utilizing data science
techniques to analyze the social behavior of electric fish.

My skills include converting unstructured data into structured formats for
statistical analysis, particularly with audio and electric recordings or other
sensor data. Proficient in Python, I use libraries like PyTorch, SciPy, and
scikit-learn. I excel in data wrangling, building data pipelines, and managing
multi-terrabyte datasets, with experience in supervised and unsupervised
learning, dimensionality reduction, and fine-tuning machine learning models
such as MLPs, CNNs, YOLO, and RCNN.

I have presented my research at prominent conferences, demonstrating my ability
to communicate complex data insights effectively. I have strong data
visualization skills, using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create customized
[visualizations](/projects/dataviz/) that meet high scientific standards.

For more information about my work and to discuss potential collaborations,
please visit my [projects](/projects/) page or view my [resume](https://drive.proton.me/urls/HWGG6TBFXW#AxUE8Hd8JSaJ). I look forward to connecting
with you!
