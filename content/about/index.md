## Research 

Why are some species social while others are not? How do animals communicate
with each other, and what information do they convey? These questions drive my
research, which lies at the intersection of ecology, behavior, and
neurobiology. I am broadly interested in how these fields can be integrated to
understand the development and function of **social behaviors** and **communication**
in animals.

Electric fish offer a unique opportunity to study these phenomena as they offer
a wide variety of social lives that can be explored through electric signals.
We design and deploy electrode arrays and required analysis software to monitor
electric fish in their natural habitats. This non-invasive technology captures
electrolocation- and communication signals and tracks movement, providing
detailed, quantitative observation of behavior in the wild—an approach that is
unique to electric fish.

Using data analyses and machine learning, we process the large-scale
datasets generated from field recordings, which allows us to detect subtle
patterns in communication and movement. I aim to observe, compare, and
understand social interactions in electric eels and other species of electric
fish in their natural environments.

By combining the study of communication signals and movement patterns, I seek
to uncover how and why animals interact during courtship, competition, and
foraging. This way, we might start to understand how communication mediates
complex social behaviors in species where little is currently known, let alone
observable in the wild.

## Philosophy

On a personal note, I am a big proponent of open software, open data, and open
science. I believe that sharing knowledge, tools and data is essential for
reproducibility and the advancement of science. This is why I am a big fan of
anything scriptable: Code is the best way to document, share and reproduce data
analysis workflows. You can find anything including analysis code, poster
and presentation templates and my Linux system configuration on my
[GitHub](https://github.com/weygoldt) page.

<!---
With knowledge in applied machine learning, software development, and data
analysis, I am currently pursuing master’s degrees in Neurobiology and
Evolution and Ecology. My focus is on utilizing data science
techniques to analyze the social behavior of electric fish.

My skills include converting unstructured data into structured formats for
statistical analysis, particularly with audio and electric recordings or other
sensor data. Proficient in Python, I use libraries like PyTorch, SciPy, and
scikit-learn. I excel in data wrangling, building data pipelines, and managing
multi-terrabyte datasets, with experience in supervised and unsupervised
learning, dimensionality reduction, and fine-tuning machine learning models
such as MLPs, CNNs, YOLO, and RCNN.

I have presented my research at prominent conferences, demonstrating my ability
to communicate complex data insights effectively. I have strong data
visualization skills, using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create customized
[visualizations](/projects/dataviz/) that meet high scientific standards.
